Tapir is a PIR-based TAP (Test Anything Protocol) Harness

It eats test output and tells humans if the test suite passed, and if not,
which kind of pretty colors of smoke came out.

The only requirement for Tapir is Parrot 1.8.0 or higher.

To run the Tapir test suite with Tapir:

    $ parrot t/harness.pir t/*.t

Also, you can always use parrot or prove to run Tapir tests individually:

    $ parrot t/01-parse_plan.t

You should see something like:

1..3
ok 1 - parse_plan can parse a simple plan
ok 2 - parse_plan can parse a single test plan
ok 3 - parse_plan can parse a no-test plan
