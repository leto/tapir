=head1 These are things that need doin', in rough order of most-wanted first

Please let me know if you start hacking on one of these or if you have any amazing ideas.

* Integrate Tapir so that it plays nicely with setup.pir, i.e. "parrot setup.pir build" and "parrot setup.pir test"
    The fakecutable is probably not being created correctly.
    There should be at least 2 ways to run the tests: Tapir and prove

* Availability/Installability
    in the Parrot tree (in ext/ like nqp-rx)

* Implement new command-line options with Getopt::Obj :
    --help
    --shuffle
    --merge
    --env       # see https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=50215

  See _parse_opts() in t/harness.pir for examples

* Tests and implementation for out of order test notification

* Running tests in parallel
    How to do it? There should be examples in the Parrot test suite

* Parse bailout correctly

    http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/ANDYA/Test-Harness-3.17/lib/TAP/Parser/Grammar.pm

* Be able to run tests written in different languages in the same test run

    Currently, Tapir assumes tests are in PIR unless given an --exec argument.

    Run /bin/sh -c or ./file, and then default to parrot if neither work ?

    Turns out /bin/sh -c foo.t means foo.t must be executable.

    We also have the option of using proc_exec from the global parrot config


* More detailed statistics in test summary : test runtime

* Aggregation step in t/harness.pir needs to be abstracted out into Tapir::Harness and tested properly

* Use yaml tests in the t/source directory of  https://svn.hexten.net/tapx/tap-tests

    It would be nice if we could parse the YAML in PIR and treats these YAML files as
    some kind of spec test suite for TAP
    http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/ANDYA/Test-Harness-3.17/lib/TAP/Parser/Aggregator.pm

* Benchmark tapir against Test::Harness (3.x and 2.x) and (maybe) Test::Run, with euler_bench
    Test::Run   http://web-cpan.berlios.de/modules/Test-Run/
    euler_bench http://github.com/notbenh/euler_bench

* Submitting smoke reports to smolder
    option --archive
    TAP::Harness::Archive for Parrot
    and a easy way to append extra properties in meta.yml

* How to deal with differences been TAP versions?

* Pluggable output formats
