    Following in the steps of other open source projects that
    eventually take over the world, here is the partial list
    of people who have contributed to tapir and its supporting
    works.  It is sorted by name and formatted to allow easy
    grepping and beautification by scripts.
    The fields are: name (N), email (E), web-address (W),
    description (D), main username (U), alias usernames (A)
    and snail-mail address (S).

        Thanks,

        The tapir Team
        PS: Yes, this looks remarkably like the Linux CREDITS format
